# UFSC Update Notifier

This is a solution that notifies a list of registered e-mails addresses whenever there is a new update on UFSC 2024 Vestibular site.

This project started as a simple script I'd do only to solve my own on pain and fear of losing any update on the vestibular site, since any inattention may cause a loss of place. But, while developing, it randomly happened to me that I could publish this service online and enable everyone to use it. So, that's what I did by creating an API that will register e-mails, and then, the script that would only send to me, will send e-mails to every entry of the list.

Hope you make good use (;
